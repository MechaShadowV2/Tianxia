EVTOPTC_JAPAN_5;Not ideal...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_101;Before the invites for the hanami can be sent out, you will need to make some preparations. It shouldn't take very long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_101;Let's get started!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_102;While your guests will be staying in your court for some time during the hanami, you still need to decide whether the main event will take place during the day or the night. Which will it be?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_102;The day!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_102;The night!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_103;During your preparations for the hanami, you have considered various forms of entertainment for your guests. One option would be to hire some shirabyoshi to entertain your guests. Do you wish to hire a few?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_103;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_103;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_104;Your capital could use some embellishments during the hanami. The commoners would appreciate it, for one thing, and chances are the guests would like it too. Do you want to decorate the capital?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_104;Decorate it modestly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_104;Decorate it extensively;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_104;Don't decorate it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_105;Some of the nearby Shinto shrines would doubtlessly appreciate it if you sent some offerings for the kami as part of the hanami celebrations. Do you want to do that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_105;Send a small offering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_105;Send a great offering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_105;Send a tainted offering;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_105;Send nothing;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_106;Word has reached you that [From.GetBestName] is sending some offerings to a Shinto shrine in preparation for an upcoming hanami. You believe you have the opportunity to taint those offerings, should you wish to use it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_106;Taint the offerings!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_106;Too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_107;Your personal garden has seen better days, and with the guests having to spend time there to enjoy the cherry blossoms properly it might be a good idea to improve the garden. Do you wish to do so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_107;I will do it myself!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_107;I will hire a gardener!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_107;I know how to do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_107;It isn't worth it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_108;You will need to have food prepared for the hanami. The question is, how much are you willing to spend on the food?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_109;With the preparations out of the way, it is time to invite your vassals to join you for the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_110;[Root.GetTitledName], I hereby invite you to my upcoming hanami.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_110;I will attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_110;I won't attend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_111;[Root.GetTitledName], I have no interest in joining you for your hanami, and refuse to attend.\n\nBy my hand and seal,\n[From.GetTitledName];;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JAPAN_112;Under the Cherry Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_112;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [Root.Capital.GetName], and it looks like it will be a beautiful day. As your vassals arrive from both near and far, you look out across your garden with a smile on your face.\n\nHopefully, this will be a memorable occasion, and everyone will come away from it satisfied. If not, it is too late to do anything about it now. You wave over a nearby servant and give them a few quick instructions before you head down to greet one of the new arrivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_112;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [Root.Capital.GetName], and hundreds of paper lanterns hang amongst them to illuminate the night. As your vassals arrive from both near and far, you look out across your garden with a smile on your face.\n\nHopefully, this will be a memorable occasion, and everyone will come away from it satisfied, but there are a thousand things that could go wrong. Of course, it is a bit late to worry about that now, and you do your best to put it out of your mind as you head down to greet one of the recent arrivals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_112;Welcome! Welcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JAPAN_113;Under the Cherry Blossoms;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_113;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [From.Capital.GetName] as your party arrives, and it looks like it will be a beautiful day. Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has invited vassals from both near and far, and you see both familiar faces and faces you barely recognize.\n\nThe hanami should be a memorable occasion, and you hope that you will have a good time, along with everyone else. Doubtlessly, [From.GetTitledName] has prepared for every eventuality, as [From.GetSheHe] has a smile on [From.GetHerHis] face as [From.GetSheHe] greets you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_113;The cherry blossoms are in full bloom in [From.Capital.GetName] as your party arrives, and hundreds of paper lanterns hang amongst them to illuminate the night. Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has invited vassals from both near and far, and you see both familiar faces and faces you barely recognize.\n\nThe hanami should be a memorable occasion, and you hope that everyone will have a good time. Given that [From.GetTitledName] seems unconcerned as [From.GetSheHe] greets you, there should be nothing to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_113;Thank you for inviting me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_116;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to extensively decorate [From.GetHerHis] capital for the hanami, and it truly is a sight to behold. Even if you ignore the cherry trees themselves, it is a most impressive display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_116;Indeed it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_117;Your servants inform you that they've overheard [From.GetTitledName] speak with approval of the decorations you saw fit to hang up in your capital. Clearly, not only the commoners appreciate the display.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_117;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_118;Aside from the cherry trees in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden and elsewhere, [From.Capital.GetName] is almost entirely without decorations. It seems [From.GetTitledName] cannot be bothered to show off [From.GetHerHis] wealth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_118;This is far too plain!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_119;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] has expressed [From.GetHerHis] dislike of the lack of decorations in [Root.Capital.GetName] where people could overhear [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps you should have invested more in decorations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_119;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_120;Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has seen fit to send some offerings to a nearby Shinto shrine as part of the hanami celebration, doubtlessly hoping that the kami will be pleased by this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_120;A good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_120;I should say that I approve...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_121;Shortly after thanks arrived from the shrine you sent offerings to, [From.GetTitledName] took the time to add [From.GetHerHis] own thanks to those of the priests at the shrine. It would seem that [From.GetSheHe] was impressed by your generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_121;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_122;It would seem that [From.GetTitledName] has not seen fit to send a proper offering to the kami at a nearby shrine. The priests did not see fit to complain, but you could.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_122;I am offended!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_122;Pretend to be outraged;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_123;[From.GetTitledName] requested a word in private with you, and once you were away from the other guests [From.GetSheHe] angrily complained about the lack of a proper offering for the kami of a nearby shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_123;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_125;Your attempt to taint the offerings sent to a shrine as part of the hanami has been successful. The priests sent a messenger thanking you profusedly for the offerings, which now pollute the shrine with unholy energies.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_125;Perhaps I should send more "gifts"...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_126;A priest arrived today from the shrine you sent offerings to, informing you that the offerings seemed unclean and that the priests had decided not to present them to the kami. However, you don't seem to be under suspicion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_126;Not as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_127;It would seem the priests at the shrine you sent some tainted offerings to are a suspicious lot. The sabotage was discovered, and now fingers are being pointed your way. Nothing can be proven, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_127;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_129;Your tainting of the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine went well. The priests have sent word that they are thankful for the offerings, and clearly they are not suspecting that their shine has been befouled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_129;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_130;Your attempt to taint the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine did not pan out. The priests discovered that something was awry with the offerings right away, even if your involvement does not seem to be suspected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_130;Not as planned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_131;Word has reached you from the shrine you sent some offerings to that someone has attempted to pollute them. The priests are convinced that you are not to blame, but they cannot determine whose fault it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_131;Who did this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_132;You attempted to taint the offerings [FromFrom.GetTitledName] sent to the kami at a nearby shrine, but this has turned out poorly. There is no proof, but you have heard whispers suggesting your involvement, and perhaps someone will believe them...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_132;This is bad...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_133;The hanami at [From.GetTitledName]'s capital is mainly taking place beneath the cherry trees in the garden. You have seen well-tended gardens in the past, but the garden of [From.GetTitledName] is one of the best you've encountered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_133;I really like it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_134;[From.GetTitledName] appears to be awestruck at the state of your garden, and has been heard praising the work that has been done there in preparation for the hanami. Evidently, you made the right decision to improve it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_134;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_135;While the cherry trees in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden are in full bloom, the effect is somewhat diminished by the poor state of the garden as a whole. It seems [From.GetTitledName] doesn't care about tending it at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_135;How unsightly!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_136;You did not put a lot of effort into improving your garden before the start of the hanami, and [From.GetTitledName] appears to be horrified at the state of it as [From.GetSheHe] has been heard loudly complaining about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_136;Not great...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_137;While [From.GetTitledName] has prepared some diversions during the hanami, [From.GetSheHe] does not appear to have seen fit to hire any entertainers despite it being a perfect occasion to bring out some shirabyoshi to entertain everyone present.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_137;This is boring!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_138;[From.GetTitledName] has been complaining loudly about the lack of shirabyoshi where all of the guests could overhear [From.GetHerHim]. Perhaps you should have paid for some entertainment to avoid upsetting [From.GetHerHim] and everyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_138;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_139;The shirabyoshi you hired to entertain your guests did not show up on time, and as more and more time passes you slowly realize that they probably aren't coming. Given that they have not seen fit to send an explanation, they have probably made a run for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_139;Thieves!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_140;[From.GetTitledName] has been claiming that there would be shirabyoshi entertaining the guests at some point during the hanami, but they never make an appearance, and [From.GetTitledName] offers no explanation for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_140;Were any actually hired?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_141;The shirabyoshi you hired show up on time and start to entertain the guests with their music and dancing. However, you quickly realize that they aren't particularly skilled in their chosen field, and the entertainment isn't particularly enjoyable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_141;I want my money back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_142;[From.GetTitledName] has hired some shirabyoshi to entertain everyone at the hanami, but they aren't particularly good as their songs are off-key and their dancing is uncoordinated at best.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_142;Make them stop!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_143;Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetTitledName], has hired some shirabyoshi to perform at [From.GetHerHis] hanami, and you find their entertainment inspiring. You get the opportunity to approach them to ask for advice on a certain skill.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_143;Teach me how to fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_143;Tell me about business!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_143;Tell me about poetry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_143;Teach me to convince!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_144;It seems your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetBestName] has been inspired by the shirabyoshi you hired and has learned from them after talking with them for a while. Hopefully, this will be an advantage in the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_144;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_145;As you take a walk amongst the cherry trees on your own, you come across [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. You have always been curious about whether the shirabyoshi know how to use the sword they wear, and when you inquire about it [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] suggests a duel to find out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_145;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_145;This is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_146;[From.GetTitledName] has approached you and let you know that [From.GetSheHe] and [event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] are planning to duel one another as [From.GetTitledName] wants to know if the shirabyoshi can fight or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_146;I'll allow it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_146;This is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_147;Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has refused your request to duel [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], claiming that that is not the kind of entertainment [From.GetSheHe] hired the shirabyoshi to perform.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_147;I could have taken her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_149;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] were apparently planning to fight a duel to find out if the latter only carries a sword for show or if she actually knows how to use it, but it would seem [From.GetTitledName] has forbidden it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_149;It could have been fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_150;Your liege, [From.GetTitledName], has approved your request to duel [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. As the final preparations are being made, you need to determine how you will approach the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_150;Hold back a bit;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_150;Fight fairly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_150;Try a few tricks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_150;Fight to kill;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_151;[From.GetTitledName] will soon be fighting you in a duel to find out if you can fight or if your sword is just for show. How do you want to approach the duel?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_152;It seems [FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi] will soon be fighting a duel, supposedly because [FromFrom.GetTitledName] is curious about whether shirabyoshi know how to fight. Perhaps it will be for show, or perhaps the two combatants will try to kill one another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_152;This should be fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_154;The duel between you and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] isn't over in an instant, but you gain the upper hand relatively quickly and keep the pressure up until you can manage to disarm the shirabyoshi.\n\n"The fight is yours, my [Root.GetLordLady]," she says, bowing her head.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_154;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_154;Was that all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_154;DIE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_155;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. Surprisingly enough, [From.GetTitledName] still seemed convinced that [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was a competent fighter, complimenting her for putting up a good fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_155;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. However, instead of being a good winner, [From.GetTitledName] decided to mock the shirabyoshi for thinking that she had a chance in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_155;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_156;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName], even if it wasn't a quick victory. It seems as if the shirabyoshi impressed [FromFrom.GetTitledName], though, since [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saw fit to compliment her skills after the duel was over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_156;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName], even if it wasn't a quick victory. Upon disarming the shirabyoshi, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] saw fit to be a poor winner and mocked the shirabyoshi for challenging [FromFrom.GetHerHim] in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_156;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_157;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] was a bit more drawn out than expected, but eventually [From.GetTitledName] prevailed. However, apparently simply disarming the shirabyoshi wasn't good enough for [From.GetTitledName], as [From.GetSheHe] decided to strike down the unarmed woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_157;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_158;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName], even if it wasn't a quick victory. The shirabyoshi surrendered upon losing her sword, but [FromFrom.GetTitledName] did not see fit to let her live and struck her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_158;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_159;Your duel against [FromFrom.GetBestName] goes on for quite some time with neither of you getting the upper hand, and eventually [FromFromFromFrom.GetTitledName] declares it a draw. Are you prepared to admit that the shirabyoshi was quite good, or will you claim you held back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_159;You're good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_159;I held back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_160;[From.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel went on for a considerable amount of time without either party getting the upper hand, and eventually you had to declare it a draw. Surprisingly, [From.GetTitledName] saluted the shirabyoshi and praised her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_160;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_161;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel was indecisive, and [From.GetTitledName] eventually had to call it a draw. Surprisingly enough, this outcome appears to have been acceptable for [FromFrom.GetTitledName] as [FromFrom.GetSheHe] saluted the shirabyoshi at the end.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_161;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_162;[From.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel went on for a considerable amount of time without either party getting the upper hand, and eventually you had to declare it a draw. [From.GetTitledName] loudly claimed that [From.GetSheHe] held back as [From.GetSheHe] sheathed [From.GetHerHis] sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_162;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_163;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] and [FromFromFromFrom.GetBestName]'s duel was indecisive, and [From.GetTitledName] eventually had to call it a draw. As [FromFrom.GetSheHe] sheathed [FromFrom.GetHerHis] sword, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] loudly claimed that [FromFrom.GetSheHe] was holding back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_163;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_164;Your duel against [From.GetTitledName] is not completely one-sided, but you gain the upper hand eventually and manage to disarm [From.GetHerHim]. You could demand [From.GetHerHis] surrender at this point, or just strike [From.GetHerHim] down where [From.GetSheHe] stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_164;Well fought, my [From.GetLordLady]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_164;DIE!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_166;Your duel against [FromFrom.GetBestName] does not go well. It isn't entirely one-sided, but eventually the shirabyoshi prevails and manages to disarm you, and you are forced to yield. You might be able to claim that you didn't fight at your full potential, should you wish to.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_166;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_166;I held back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_167;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] wasn't particularly even, and eventually the shirabyoshi triumphed. Surprisingly enough, [From.GetTitledName] did not seem to have an hard feelings towards [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and instead praised her skills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_167;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_168;[From.GetTitledName] did not prevail in [From.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. However, instead of trying to save face, [From.GetTitledName] decided to praise the shirabyoshi's skills after the fight was over, which seemed to please her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_168;Was she that good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_169;[From.GetTitledName]'s duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] wasn't particularly even, and eventually the shirabyoshi triumphed. As the shirabyoshi walked away, [From.GetTitledName] loudly proclaimed that [From.GetSheHe] was holding back the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_169;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_170;[From.GetTitledName] did not prevail in [From.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName]. As the shirabyoshi sheathed her sword and started to walk away, [From.GetTitledName] started to claim that [From.GetSheHe] was holding back the whole time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_170;Sore loser...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_171;Your duel against [FromFrom.GetBestName] does not go well. It isn't entirely one-sided, but eventually the shirabyoshi prevails and manages to disarm you. Before you have the chance to yield, she raises her sword again and cuts you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_171;NOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_172;[FromFrom.GetBestName] managed to prevail against [From.GetTitledName] in their duel, and the shirabyoshi is not content with simply beating her opponent. Before [From.GetTitledName] manages to surrender, [From.GetSheHe] is cut down by [FromFrom.GetBestName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_172;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_172;Imprison that woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_173;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] did not win [FromFrom.GetHerHis] duel against [FromFromFrom.GetBestName], and the shirabyoshi is completely merciless on victory, striking [FromFrom.GetTitledName] down where [FromFrom.GetSheHe] stands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_173;How uncivilized!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_174;Amongst the shirabyoshi you hired, [event_target:remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] truly stands out as exceptional, and she offers to stay at your court after the hanami is over. This is too good an opportunity to turn down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_174;Stay as long as you like!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_175;One of the shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired, [From.event_target:remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], has proven to be a far better performer than the average shirabyoshi, and you are not surprised when you learn that she will become a permanent member of [From.GetTitledName]'s court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_175;Good for [From.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_176;There is always a risk that the weather will be bad during the day of the hanami, which can ruin the experience, but the weather could not have been better this time, and everyone can fully enjoy the festivities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_176;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_177;You have had some fun spending time with [From.event_target:hanami_friend_2.GetBestName] at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami. Perhaps you should become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_177;Let's become friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_177;Let's not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_178;[From.GetBestName] appears to like your company at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and you also enjoy their company. It comes as no surprise when [From.GetBestName] suggests the two of you should become friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_178;Let's become friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_178;Let's not;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_179;[From.GetBestName] seems to have enjoyed your company too, as [From.GetSheHe] is happy to declare you [From.GetHerHis] friend. Surely, this is the start of many great things!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_179;It would seem [From.GetBestName] hasn't enjoyed your company as much as you've enjoyed spending thime with [From.GetHerHim], as [From.GetSheHe] claims to have no interest to become your friend.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_179;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_179;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_180;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami [From.event_target:hanami_rival_2.GetBestName] has been extremely poor company, and you cannot help but to feel insulted by the way they speak to you. Do you intend to demand an apology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_180;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_180;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_181;[From.GetBestName] appears to have taken some things you've said during [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s personally, and [From.GetSheHe] has demanded that you apologize for the things you've said. Is this something you want to do?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_181;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_181;Of course I'll apologize!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_182;[From.GetBestName] refused to apologize to you, and doubled down on [From.GetHerHis] insults towards you. It is clear that this is the start of a rivalry between the two of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_182;[From.GetBestName] apparently did not mean the things [For.GetSheHe] said and has apologized over the insults, seemingly sincerely sorry to have offended you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_182;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_182;Apology accepted!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_183;During the hanami, you come across [event_target:arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [event_target:arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] loudly arguing with one another. You cannot tell what the reason for their quarrel is, but perhaps you could try to smooth things over.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_183;Try to calm them down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_183;Quietly walk away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_184;It seems your attempt to smooth things over has been successful, for [event_target:arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [event_target:arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] quickly calm down and are conversing as friends again by the time you're walking away from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_184;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_185;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, you and another vassal ended up arguing with one another. Luckily, [From.GetTitledName] managed to clear up the misunderstanding and you now know that there was no reason to get angry with anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_185;Thanks for the help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_186;Your attempt to meddle in the argument between [event_target:arguing_hanami_vassal_1.GetBestName] and [event_target:arguing_hanami_vassal_2.GetBestName] did not go well, and they are now angry with both you and one another. Perhaps it would have been better if you hadn't meddled.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_186;Not good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_187;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, you and another vassal ended up arguing with one another. [From.GetTitledName] apparently thought that [From.GetSheHe] could be a diplomat and clear things up, but [From.GetSheHe] only made things worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_187;You are still wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_188;A priestess from a nearby shrine made an unexpected appearance at your hanami, offering to say a few words and to make a small offering to the kami in your name after you welcomed her to the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_188;Sure, why not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_189;As [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami continues, you find yourself talking to [From.event_target:hanami_lover_2.GetBestName], a very lovely [From.event_target:hanami_lover_2.GetManWoman]. You cannot tell for sure, but they might be interested in you in a romantic way, and it would be easy to slip away into the night with them if they agree to it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_189;Try to seduce them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_189;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_190;You have been talking to [From.GetBestName] for quite some time at [FromFrom.GetTitled] and think that they are a fine [From.GetManWoman]. It does not surprise you particularly much when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that the two of you should find someplace private to get to know one another more closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_190;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_190;No, I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_191;[From.GetBestName] did not seem to appreciate your attempt to get to know them intimately, and [From.GetSheHe] hastily ended your conversation and hurried away. Hopefully, they will not speak of your suggestion with anyone else.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_191;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_192;[From.GetBestName] was amenable to your suggestion to slip away into the darkness to get to know one another intimately, and it is not long before you find a secluded part of [FromFromFrom.GetTitledName]'s garden and start to get undressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_192;It is good to be the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_193;You have taken a short break from the festivities and are taking a walk through a secluded part of your garden when you hear a sound from behind some bushes. You go around them and find [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] entwined with one another, neither of them wearing any clothes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_193;Keep it secret;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_193;Attempt to blackmail them;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_193;Tell everyone;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_194;[From.GetTitledName] stumbled upon you and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] in a compromising position, but it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is content to keep it secret, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_194;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_195;[From.GetTitledName] stumbled upon you and [FromFrom.GetBestName] in a compromising position, but it appears that [From.GetSheHe] is content to keep it secret, at least for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_195;Phew!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_196;[From.GetTitledName] discovered you and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] together in a compromising position. Before either of you can speak, [From.GetTitledName] asks you what [From.GetHerHis] silence is worth to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_196;I'll pay you some gold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_196;I'll owe you a Favor!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_196;I won't be blackmailed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_JAPAN_196;You will pay 25 gold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_JAPAN_196;You will owe a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_198;[FromFrom.GetTitledName] discovered you and [From.GetBestName] together in a compromising position. Before either of you can speak, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] asks you what [FromFrom.GetHerHis] silence is worth to you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_199;Both [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] agreed to pay you off to keep their tryst secret without any complaints.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_199;I will keep it secret, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPA_JAPAN_199;[This.GetBestName] pays you 25 gold;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIPB_JAPAN_199;[This.GetBestName] owes you a Favor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_200;You could not get [event_target:hanami_lover_1.GetBestName] and [event_target:hanami_lover_2.GetBestName] to agree to any concessions in exchange for your silence, and this leaves you no option but to expose their tryst to everyone at the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_200;You asked for it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_201;[From.GetTitledName] has outed your tryst to everyone at the hanami, and since there is no possible way for you to attempt to cover up the situation the scandal is a fact.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_201;Oh no!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_202;[From.GetTitledName] somehow caught wind of the fact that [FromFrom.GetBestName] and [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] were sleeping together, and has outed their relationship to everyone at the hanami. Given that the two were discovered together in a state of undress, there is no plausible alternative explanation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_202;How scandalous!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_202;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_202;They will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_203;It seems the sounds from your hanami carries well beyond your garden, for some of the townspeople have sent a message asking you to try to quiet things down a bit so that they can sleep properly.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_203;We'll tone it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_203;Shut up, peasant!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_204;In the middle of the night, you can see something moving about in the darkness just at the edge of your vision. You cannot tell who or what it is, and it might just be your mind playing tricks on you, but that is not certain...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_204;Who goes there?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_204;Guards! GUARDS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_205;As the hanami continues, you find [event_target:sleeping_hanami_vassal.GetBestName] asleep in a somewhat secluded part of your garden. The temptation to draw something on [event_target:sleeping_hanami_vassal.GetHerHis] face is almost impossible to overcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_205;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_205;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_207;You accidentally fell asleep during the hanami in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden since you slept poorly the night before. When you wake up, you hear the sound of laughter, and it does not take you long to discover that someone has drawn something inappropriate on your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_207;Who did this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_208;You accidentally fell asleep during the hanami in [From.GetTitledName]'s garden since you slept poorly the night before. Before long, you wake up to discover that [From.GetTitledName] is trying to draw something on your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_208;What are you doing?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_209;[From.GetBestName] wakes up as you are drawing on their face and angrily demand that you stop. It would seem [From.GetSheHe] was not as soundly asleep as you had thought that [From.GetSheHe] was, or that you are considerably less stealthy than you thought.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_209;It was just a prank!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_210;You have made sure that there is plenty of sake for the guests at your hanami, and know for sure that there is enough to go around even if you have some. Surely there is no harm in drinking some?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_210;Drink in moderation;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_210;Drink a lot;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_210;Drink more than you should;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_211;The cherry blossoms at the hanami are certainly inspiring, and you find yourself in the mood for writing some poetry. Perhaps you should challenge [From.GetTitledName] to a poetry contest?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_211;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_211;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_212;[From.GetTitledName] appears to feel inspired by the cherry blossoms and has suggested that the two of you compete with one another in a poetry contest. Do you agree to the proposal?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_213;It would seem [From.GetTitledName] has no interest in poetry, for [From.GetSheHe] turned down your suggested poetry contest right away and suggested that [From.GetSheHe] had better things to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_213;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_215;After you and your opponent have written your poems, you hand them over to some of the other guests to read so that they may choose a winner. After some deliberation, they decide that you have won.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_215;I am a poet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_215;That was nice!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_215;As expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_216;After you and your opponent have written your poems, you hand them over to some of the other guests to read so that they may choose a winner. After some deliberation, they decide that you have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_216;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_217;[From.event_target:hanami_duel_vassal_2.GetBestName] has insulted you during the hanami, and it would be well within your rights to challenge them to a duel. Do you wish to do so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_217;Challenge them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_217;Let's not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_218;Apparently, [From.GetBestName] feels that you have insulted [From.GetHerHim] at the hanami, and [From.GetSheHe] is now challenging you to a duel. However, if you apologize, the duel could be avoided.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_218;Bring it on!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_218;I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_219;It appears [From.GetBestName] does not wish to fight you, as [From.GetSheHe] instead has apologized for upsetting you. Perhaps it is for the best to let the matter rest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_219;Very well!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_220;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, [From.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_220;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, neither came out ahead in the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JAPAN_220;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_220;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_221;You and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and you quickly get the upper hand. Before long, they are disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_221;You and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, but it becomes clear that neither of you can get the upper hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JAPAN_221;You and [FromFrom.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and they quickly get the upper hand. Before long, you are disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_JAPAN_221;You and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and they quickly get the upper hand. Before long, you are disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_JAPAN_221;You and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, but it becomes clear that neither of you can get the upper hand.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCF_JAPAN_221;You and [From.GetTitledName] fight one another for some time, and you quickly get the upper hand. Before long, they are disarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_221;Yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_221;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_221;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_221;I yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JAPAN_221;Let's call it a draw!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_JAPAN_221;Yield!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_222;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, [From.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_222;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, neither came out ahead in the duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JAPAN_222;It seems [From.GetBestName] and [FromFrom.GetBestName] have quarreled during the hanami and that only a duel could settle the matter. Whether there were other options or not, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] has triumphed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_222;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_223;[From.GetTitledName] has has several truly magnificient meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_223;Approve publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_223;Disapprove publicly;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_223;Stay silent;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_224;[From.GetTitledName] has has several decent meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_225;[From.GetTitledName] has has several very plain meals prepared for the hanami. Doubtlessly, [From.GetSheHe] would like to hear if [From.GetHerHis] guests liked the food.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_226;Apparently, [From.GetTitledName] likes the quality of the food you had prepared for the hanami and has seen fit to publicly praise you for it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_226;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_227;Apparently, [From.GetTitledName] does not like the quality of the food you had prepared for the hanami and has seen fit to publicly complain about it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_227;Shut up!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_228;As the hanami continues, you come across [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] several more times and find her company enjoyable. Perhaps you two should try to get closer?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_228;We should be lovers!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_228;We should be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_228;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_229;It seems [From.GetBestName] fancies you as [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that you retire to [From.GetHerHis] bedchamber to get to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_229;I like how [From.GetSheHe] thinks!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_229;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_230;[From.GetBestName] proved to be amenable to your suggestion, and soon the two of you have managed to find your way to your bedchamber. It does not take long before the two of you are fully undressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_230;This is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_231;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming your lover, as she turned down your proposition and quickly hurried away. Perhaps she will change her mind in the future, but it will not happen during the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_231;I see..;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_232;[From.GetBestName] seems to have taken an interest in getting to know you better after your duel, and now it seems [From.GetSheHe] wishes to be your friend. The question is, do you think [From.GetSheHe] would make a good friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_232;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_232;Never!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_233;[From.GetBestName] is elated when you propose that the two of you should begin a long-term friendship. Regardless of how your duel went, it seems you can put your differences aside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_233;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_234;It seems [From.GetBestName] has no interest in becoming friends with you. Perhaps the events surrounding your duel with her are to blame, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_234;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_235;[event_target:shirabyoshi_foe.GetBestName] did not treat you courteously at the end of your duel with [event_target:shirabyoshi_foe.GetHerHim]. As the hanami continues, you believe that you see an opportunity to kill [event_target:shirabyoshi_foe.GetHerHim]. Do you want to try?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_235;Yes, [event_target:shirabyoshi_foe.GetSheHe] must die!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_235;It is too risky...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_236;As you are walking by yourself in a secluded part of [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s garden, [From.GetBestName] appears out of nowhere with her sword in her hand. With a loud war cry, she moves to attack you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_236;Try to fight her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_236;Try to flee;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_237;Somehow you manage to slip away from [FromFrom.GetBestName] in the gardem without being wounded. You suspect that she still is looking for you, and waste no time before ordering her arrest when you encounter some of the guards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_237;Find that woman!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_238;It seems [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] has been attacked by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] the shirabyoshi [From.GetSheHe] fought a duel against previously. The attack was unsuccessful, but so was the attempt to apprehend the shirabyoshi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_238;Let her run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_239;You make your best attempt to slip away from [FromFrom.GetBestName], but in your haste you trip over a rock and fall to the ground. Before you can get back to your feet or draw your sword, the shirabyoshi is upon you, and she shows you no mercy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_239;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_240;Some of your guards stumbled upon the lifeless body of [From.GetBestName] in the garden. It would seen that an unknown assailant attacked [From.GetHerHim] and killed [From.GetHerHim], presumably with a sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_240;Who could have done this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_240;I have some suspicions, but...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_240;The shirabyoshi did it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_241;You draw your sword and meet [FromFrom.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a decent enough fighter, as you learned before, but she is no match for you, and you manage to find an opening and quickly strike her down without her inflicting so much as a scratch on you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_241;Now we know the better fighter!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_242;[From.GetBestName] returns to the other guests after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in your garden, and quickly informs you that [From.GetSheHe] was attacked by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] and was forced to kill her in self-defense, taking no wounds in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_242;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_243;You draw your sword and meet [FromFrom.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a decent enough fighter, as you learned before, and she inflicts several wounds on you before you manage to strike her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_243;That will probably scar...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_244;[From.GetBestName] returns to the other guests after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in your garden, and quickly informs you that [From.GetSheHe] was attacked by [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] and was forced to kill her in self-defense. Judging by [From.GetHerHis] wounds, she didn't go down without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_244;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_245;You draw your sword and meet [FromFrom.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a good fighter, as you learned before, and though you manage to strike her down in the end she has severely wounded you in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_245;At least I survived...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_246;[From.GetBestName] returns to the other guests after having taken a walk alone elsewhere in your garden, severely injured, but with a smile on [From.GetHerHis] face. Apparently, [FromFromFrom.GetBestName] attacked [From.GetHerHim] and [From.GetSheHe] narrowly managed to beat her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_246;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_247;You draw your sword and meet [FromFrom.GetBestName] head on. The shirabyoshi is a good fighter, and she manages to find an opening in your defences quickly enough, drawing blood. One wound becomes two, then three, and eventually you lack the strength to keep her from striking you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_247;NOOOOOO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_248;Some of your guards stumbled upon the lifeless body of [From.GetBestName] in the garden. As the shirabyoshi [From.GetSheHe] fought earlier is nowhere to be found, it seems that she killed [From.GetHerHim] and then fled before the body was discovered.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_248;Let her run!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_249;The shirabyoshi you fought before, [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], was a competent fighter, which resulted in humiliation for you. Still, you believe you know her weaknesses and see an opportunity to attack her, if you so wish.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_249;Attack her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_249;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_250;You surprise [FromFrom.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not enough so that she is unable to put up some resistance. However, the fight quickly turns in your favor, and you manage to kill her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_250;I win this time!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_251;You surprise [FromFrom.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not enough so that she is unable to put up some resistance, and she manages to inflict several minor wounds before the fight turns in your favor and you can cut her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_251;'Tis but a scratch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_252;You surprise [FromFrom.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], though not enough so that she is unable to put up some resistance. She manages to get in several good strikes, and you don't walk away from the fight in one piece despite eventually cutting her down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_252;At least I still live...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_253;It seems [From.GetBestName] has attacked [event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] in your garden. It is doubtful that it was in self-defense, but you can't punish [From.GetBestName] without knowing for sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_253;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_254;[FromFrom.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as you move to attack her, and she meets you with her sword drawn. Before long, the fight turns against you, and eventually she strikes you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_254;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_255;[FromFrom.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as you move to attack her, and she meets you with her sword drawn. Though you manage to wound her, the fight turns against you, and eventually she strikes you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_255;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_256;[FromFrom.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is not surprised as you move to attack her, and she meets you with her sword drawn. You make sure that she won't walk away in one piece, but the fight turns against you, and eventually she strikes you down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_256;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_257;[event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] demands to speak to you, and you agree to her request. She tells you that [From.GetBestName] attacked her in your garden and that she was forced to kill [From.GetHerHim] in self-defense.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_257;You did the right thing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_257;Leave my court, now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_257;Guards, seize her!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_258;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, and [From.GetTitledName] apparently believes her, allowing her to remain free and at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_258;She should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_259;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, and [From.GetTitledName] apparently believes her, allowing her to remain free, though not at court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_259;She should be imprisoned!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_260;Apparently, [FromFrom.GetBestName] has been killed by [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]. According to the shirabyoshi, it was in self-defense, but [From.GetTitledName] still has seen fit to imprison her.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_260;Serves her right!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_261;[From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName]'s skill with a sword was most impressive, and you've decided to learn from her. She teaches you quite a few tricks in a surprisingly short amount of time, and you find that you have more in common than an interest in swordfighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_261;I have a new best friend!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_262;It seems [From.event_target:troublesome_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] and [From.GetBestName] have become friends and that the shirabyoshi is teaching your [GetFromRelation] how to fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_262;That's... good?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_263;[event_target:remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] is a most impressive woman, and you find that you are enjoying spending time with her. Perhaps this is the start of a lasting friendship, or it could perhaps be more...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_263;Try to seduce her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_263;Try to befriend her;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_263;No, this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_264;[From.GetTitledName] seems to have been enjoying your performance throughout the hanami, and it does not come as a big surprise when [From.GetSheHe] suggests that perhaps you should come with [From.GetHerHim] somewhere more private for a different form of entertainment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_264;I like the sound of that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_264;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_265;[From.GetBestName] agreed to your suggestion that the two of you should retire to somewhere private, and it doesn't take very long before both of you are undressed and getting to know one another more intimately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_265;It is good to be the [Root.GetTitle]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_266;Your suggestion that you and [From.GetBestName] should retire to somewhere private was not appreciated by the shirabyoshi, and she hastily excused herself and headed elsewhere. While still in your court, it seems like she won't be in your bed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_266;Not as planned...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_267;It seems [From.GetTitledName] truly is enjoying your company, and that [From.GetSheHe] wishes to remain on good terms with you. Indeed, [From.GetSheHe] has suggested that you perhaps should be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_267;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_267;I'd rather not...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_268;[From.GetBestName] seems very open to the idea of being friends with you. Doubtlessly this will only bring good things down the line as she truly is a remarkable woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_268;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_269;Despite your generous suggestion, [From.GetBestName] does not seem open to the idea of becoming friends with you. Perhaps it will change over time, but perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_269;I see...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_270;[event_target:remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] does not cease to impress as the hanami continues. Her singing voice is beautiful, her dancing is impeccable, and her poetry is awe-inspiring. You couldn't have found a better shirabyoshi easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_270;She truly is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_271;[From.event_target:remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName], one of the shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami, truly is something special. Her singing voice is beautiful, her dancing is impeccable, and her poetry is awe-inspiring. You are not sure you've ever seen better.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_271;She truly is great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_272;[event_target:remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] truly is a remarkable woman, and she seems to have a much better grasp of military matters than you would have expected from a shirabyoshi, greater than many of your potential commanders. Perhaps you should make her one of you commanders?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_272;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_272;No, this is a bad idea...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_273;[From.GetTitledName] has seen fit to appoint [From.event_target:remarkable_shirabyoshi.GetBestName] as a commander, which is a highly irregular decision since she's a woman and [From.GetTitledName] usually doesn't allow them to command troops.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_273;That is just wrong!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_273;Why can she command and not I?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_274;The shirabyoshi you hired for the hanami have performed quite well throughout the event. While none of them are truly exceptional, there is no doubt that they still are well-trained entertainers fit to entertain the likes of you and your guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_274;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_275;The shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami are quite good. They are not the kind of great shirabyoshi you are unlikely to see more than a few times in a lifetime, but they are certainly not bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_275;Keep on performing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_276;The shirabyoshi [From.GetTitledName] hired for [From.GetHerHis] hanami are getting on your nerves. While they are unfailingly polite towards everyone else, the behaviour they show towards you is anything but polite.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_276;I want them gone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_277;[From.GetTitledName] has told you that [From.GetSheHe] feels that the shirabyoshi you hired are being extremely impolite towards [From.GetHerHim], and has asked you to expel them from the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_277;Throw them out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_277;They can stay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_278;[From.GetTitledName] agreed to throw out the shirabyoshi as you requested. There will be less entertainment now, but at least the impolite shirabyoshi are not going to ruin the hanami for you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_278;Good riddance!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_279;[From.GetTitledName] did not believe you when you claimed that the shirabyoshi were being rude towards you, and [From.GetSheHe] has decided to allow them to stay at the hanami.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_279;Why take their side?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_280;You have been spending some time with [From.event_target:hanami_child_friend_rival.GetBestName] at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and [From.event_target:hanami_child_friend_rival.GetSheHe] seems to have a lot in common with you. Perhaps you should attempt to become [From.event_target:hanami_child_friend_rival.GetHerHis] friend?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_280;Yes, let's do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_280;I have enough friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_281;[From.GetBestName] and you have spent some time together at [FromFrom.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and you have enjoyed [From.GetHerHis] company. It seems the feeling is mutual, and [From.GetBestName] has suggested that you sould be friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_281;Let's be friends!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_281;I don't think so!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_282;[From.GetBestName] seemed thrilled at the prospect of becoming your friend, and [From.GetSheHe] said that your company truly had been enjoyable at the hanami. Hopefully, you will have more fun together in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_282;It seems [From.GetBestName] does not enjoy your company as much as you enjoy [From.GetHerHis], for [From.GetSheHe] found your suggestion of becoming friends silly and told you that it was not going to happen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_282;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_282;How rude!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_284;[From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetBestName] has been getting on your nerves during [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, and you find that nearly everything [From.hanami_child_friend_rival.GetSheHe] is a thinly veiled insult at best. Do you want to demand an apology?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_284;Yes!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_284;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_285;It seems [From.GetBestName] has been taking your jokes at [From.GetHerHis] expense very seriously, and [From.GetSheHe] has demanded that you say that you are sorry. If not, chances are [From.GetBestName] will hold a grudge towards you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_285;I'm not sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_285;I'm sorry!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_286;[From.GetBestName] laughed in your face when you demanded an apology for [From.GetHerHis] insults. If [From.GetSheHe] is not going to attempt to be on friendly terms, you will have to make sure that [From.GetSheHe] goes down in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_286;It seems [From.GetBestName] did not mean to insult you with the things [From.GetSheHe] said, and [From.GetSheHe] seemed most sincere when [From.GetSheHe] issued an apology. You cannot forget what was said, but it is probably best to forgive it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_286;I hate you too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_286;Fine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_288;The weather takes a turn for the worse as the hanami progresses. Dark clouds cover the sky, and you can hear thunder in the distance. You might even have to move everyone inside if the situation gets worse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_288;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_289;One of your guards informs you that there is a fireworks merchant who wishes to see you. It turns out that he has heard of your hanami and that he is willing to sell you some fireworks to entertain your guests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_289;I want some small ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_289;I want some mid-sized ones.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_289;Give me everything!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_289;I cannot afford any...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_290;The fireworks you bought from the merchant seem simple enough to use, and you make sure that your guests all will have a good view of the sky. The explosions are not particularly impressive, but it seems like the guests still liked the show.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_290;Worth the money, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_291;[From.GetTitledName] has apparently gotten hold of some fireworks for the hanami. It is not exactly in line with tradition, and they are not the most impressive you've seen, but they are still somewhat entertaining.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_291;That was nice, I guess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_292;The fireworks you bought from the merchant are a bit complicated, but you manage to figure out how to use them. Your guests seem impressed by the view as they light up the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_292;Money well spent!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_293;[From.GetTitledName] has a surprise for you and the other guests in the form of some fireworks [From.GetSheHe] apparently has bought. They light up the sky in a multitude of colors and are a sight to behold.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_293;Beautiful!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_294;You think you have figured out how to use the fireworks you bought from the merchant, but you get something wrong, and one of them explodes too close to you for comfort, and you don't get away in one piece.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_294;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_295;[From.GetTitledName] has bought some fireworks for the hanami, but apparently [From.GetSheHe] hasn't figure out how to use them safely. One of the fireworks explodes right next to [From.GetHerHim], causing a major injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_295;Play with fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_296;You are somewhat afraid of getting something wrong when you use the fireworks you bought, but luckily you get it right, and the sky is soon set ablaze. Never before have you seen anything quite as magnificient as this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_296;A most impressive display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_297;[From.GetTitledName] has you and the other guests gather where you can get a good view of the sky as [From.GetSheHe] starts setting off a large number of fireworks [From.GetSheHe] apparently has bought for the hanami. Before long, the sky is ablaze in a truly magnificient fashion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_297;A most impressive display!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_298;The fireworks you bought are more complicated than you initially thought, but you believe you have figured out how to use them safely by the time that your guests await the display. Unfortunately, something goes wrong and you are badly injured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_298;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_299;[From.GetTitledName] brings out a large amount of fireworks and proudly proclaims that you are about to witness something grand. Unfortunately for [From.GetHerHim], the fireworks are less safe than expected, and [From.GetTitledName] is maimed in thr process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_299;Play with fire...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_300;You manage to figure out how to set off the fireworks you bought without harming yourself, but one of them flies off into the crowd and blows up right in the face of [event_target:fireworks_victim.GetBestName], killing [event_target:fireworks_victim.GetHerHim], and your remaining guests look at you in horror.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_300;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_301;[From.GetTitledName] has bought a number of huge fireworks from someone and brings them out at the hanami. [From.GetSheHeCap] manages to set them off without problems at first, but one of them spirals out of control and flies directly at you, blowing up in your face.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_301;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_302;[From.GetTitledName] surprises everyone by bringing out a bunch of fireworks. Clearly, [From.GetSheHe] has a magnificient spectacle in mind, but something goes wrong and one of the fireworks hits [From.event_target:fireworks_victim.GetBestName] in the face, fatally wounding [From.event_target:fireworks_victim.GetHerHim].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_302;What a mess...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JAPAN_303;The Great Fireworks Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_303;Your guests quickly assemble when they hear that you have prepared a grand fireworks display. Everything goes well at first, and the sky is soon lit by colorful explosions. However, before long, things go horribly wrong.\n\nSoon, there are fireworks that fly off into the town itself, impacting several buildings and starting a number of fires that grow out of control very quickly, and other fireworks strike some of your guests, killing them where they stand.\n\nBy the time that the last fireworks have gone off, many are dead, and large parts of [Root.Capital.GetName] are ablaze.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_303;This is a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_JAPAN_304;The Great Fireworks Disaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_304;[From.GetTitledName] has proclaimed that there will be a major fireworks display during the hanami, and you and the other guests quickly gather to witness it.\n\nIt starts well enough, but soon there are fireworks flying off into the crowd and the nearby town, starting fires in several places and killing many people before they can escape to safety.\n\n[From.GetTitledName] is unhurt, and so are you, but it is clear that this disaster will not be something that [From.Capital.GetName] recovers from anytime soon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_304;That was a disaster!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_305;You have taken some time to look at the stars during the hanami, and you are surprised by the appearance of a comet in the sky.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_305;It's an omen!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTOOLTIP_JAPAN_305;Lose 1 stability;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_307;You and your spouse, [Root.Spouse.GetBestName], have been watching the stars together during the hanami while talking with one another, and you feel that you have gotten much closer to [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim] as a consequence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_307;I love [Root.Spouse.GetHerHim]!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_308;You and [event_target:hanami_child_friend.GetBestName] have been spending some time together watching the stars during the hanami, and you feel much closer to [event_target:hanami_child_friend.GetHerHim] now. In fact, you now consider [event_target:hanami_child_friend.GetHerHim] to be one of your best friends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_308;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_309;The sky is clear during the night of the hanami, and the stars above are beautiful to behold. You would have loved to have someone to talk to about them, but it seems your guests are more interested in the cherry blossoms than the stars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_309;Ah, those are beautiful too!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_310;You and several others at the hanami have decided to take part in an impromptu practice session in the hopes of improving your swordfighting skills. Hopefully, nothing will go wrong.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_310;Let's do it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCA_JAPAN_311;You don't know why, but as soon as you draw your sword you feel certain that things will go well. You don't distinguish yourself by having perfect form, but you show no fear against any of your opponents.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCB_JAPAN_311;Not long ago, you found the idea of swordfighting dangerous, but during the practice session you find that you actually have nothing to fear. Perhaps, with a little effort, you could excel at swordfighting.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCC_JAPAN_311;You do not distinguish yourself as much as some do at the practice session. In fact, you perform less well than you had expected to, and some of the others seem to be hiding smiles as you excuse yourself early to avoid further humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCD_JAPAN_311;The practice session does not go as well as you would have liked. You fumble with a parry and one of the others at the pracitice session accidentally gives you a cut on one of your arms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESCE_JAPAN_311;The practice session goes very well for you, and you perform very well. Several of the others suggest that you could do well as a duelist, if that is something that interests you. If not, there's still some glory to be had.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_311;I fear nothing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_311;I don't fear swords!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_311;Not good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_311;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JAPAN_311;I'm a duelist now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTF_JAPAN_311;I'll just have the glory!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_312;You have spent some time at the hanami discussing military strategy with some of your vassals. The discussion went very well, and everyone seems to agree that you've got some talent in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_312;Good news, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_312;This is the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_312;I will just have the fame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_312;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JAPAN_312;Just as expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_313;During [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami, you sent some time talking about military strategy with the other guests. The discussion went very well, and you got some praise for your knowledge in the field.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_313;Good news, everyone!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_313;This is the future!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_JAPAN_313;I will just have the fame!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_JAPAN_313;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTE_JAPAN_313;Just as expected!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_314;You took part in a discussion about military strategy during your hanami, but unfortunately nothing you said seemed to impress anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_314;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_315;You spent some time at [From.GetTitledName]'s hanami discussing military strategy with the other guests. Unfortunately, the things you say don't seem to impress anyone.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_315;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_316;You and [event_target:hanami_go_opponent.GetBestName] found the time to play a game of Go during the hanami. It was not over quickly, but eventually you were victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_316;I should keep doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_316;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_317;[From.GetTitledName] challenged you to a game of Go during the hanami, and you obliged [From.GetHerHim]. It took some time for the outcome to be clear, but eventually it was clear that you had lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_317;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_318;You and [event_target:hanami_go_opponent.GetBestName] found the time to play a game of Go during the hanami. It took some time for the outcome to be clear, but eventually it was clear that you had lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_318;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_319;[From.GetTitledName] challenged you to a game of Go during the hanami, and you obliged [From.GetHerHim]. It was not over quickly, but eventually you were victorious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_319;I should keep doing this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_JAPAN_319;Victory is mine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_322;The hanami has come to an end, and all of your guests have set off on their journey back home. You will have to wait at least one year before the next hanami can be held.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_322;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_323;[From.GetTitledName]'s hanami is over, and it is time to depart back home. Perhaps there will be another hanami next year, or perhaps not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_323;That was fun!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_324;With a war breaking out, the hanami will have to be postponed. It is doubtful that you will have time to emerge victorious quickly enough to resume the hanami this year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_324;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_JAPAN_325;[From.GetTitledName]'s hanami has unfortunately had to be cancelled due to a war breaking out, and it is doubtful that the war will be over before the cherry blossoms are gone for the year.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_JAPAN_325;Unfortunate!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
