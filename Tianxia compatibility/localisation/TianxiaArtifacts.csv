EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_2;Word has reached you that the peasants in [artifact_province.GetName] recently discovered an old sword when plowing a new field. Word has it that it might be one of the legendary Totsuka-no-Tsurugi, and thus once was wielded by a deity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_2;I must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_2;I don't care about rumours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_3;After you arrive at the village in [artifact_province.GetName], you quickly discover that there was no long-buried sword in the village in the first place. Apparently some of the villagers simply told a passing merchant a story they made up.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_3;Well, this was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_3;You'll pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_4;You arrive at the village in [artifact_province.GetName] too late, for the peasants there inform you that they sold the sword to a traveller who passed through the village a few days before your arrival.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_4;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_4;Give me the money, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_4;You will all pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_5;The Buried Sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_5;The village in [artifact_province.GetName] does not look very promising when you approach it, and you start fear that your journey has been all for naught. Still, you decide to make your way into the village and start asking around for the sword, since it would be a waste to return home without making sure whether the sword exists or not.\n\n"It is true, my [Root.GetLordLady]", a young villager eventually tells you. "I found an ancient sword recently. However, I am not interested in parting with it. You will have to duel me for it, if you want it.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_5;A duel? I accept!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_5;Guards! Get me that sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ARTIFACTS_5;Keep the sword, young man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_6;As you make ready for your duel with the young man, you start to wonder if it actually is a good idea. If the sword is one of the Totsuka-no-Tsurugi, its wielder might be formidable.\n\n"Shall we begin, my [Root.GetLordLady]?" the young man calls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_6;Yes, this is between you and me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_6;... and my GUARDS!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_6;I changed my mind!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_7;The young man puts up a surprisingly good fight, but you slowly start getting the upper hand, and eventually you find an opening in his defence, striking him down. The sword he found is now yours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_7;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_8;You would have thought that a simple villager, even one wielding a sword straight out of legend, would have been easy enough to defeat, but that does not turn out to be the case. After a while, you make a small mistake and the young man strikes home, disarming you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_8;Well fought!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_8;Guards! Kill that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_9;The duel with the young man starts off well enough, but before you can kill him or force him to yield he starts to put up a better defense. You try to find an opening, but your opponent's skill seems to improve more as the fight goes on, and soon he finds an opening, inflicting a mortal wound.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_9;NO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
forge_thuan_thien;Restore Thuan Thien;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
forge_thuan_thien_desc;If you possess both the hilt and the blade of Thuan Thien, the sword can be restored.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_12;You have started to hear rumours about a strangely glowing banyan tree in [artifact_province.GetName]. You do not know where the rumours started, but perhaps it is worth trying to find this tree?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_12;I must find this tree!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_12;I have better things to do...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_13;Shortly before you reach [artifact_province.GetName], a forest fire breaks out near where the glowing banyan tree supposedly was located, and you cannot discern which tree it was after arriving.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_13;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_14;You arrive at the site of the rumoured glowing banyan tree and discover nothing but a tree stump. When questioning the peasants in the area, you discover that they decided to cut down the tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_14;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_14;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_15;The Glowing Tree;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_15;You arrive in [artifact_province.GetName] and start asking around for the rumoured glowing banyan tree. It does not take you long to discover someone who knows where the tree can be found, and you are quickly given instructions as to how to reach it.\n\nUpon arriving at the site, you are awestruck by the sight of the tree. For some reason you cannot describe, the branches of the tree seem to be glowing faintly. It truly is a wonderous sight.\n\nPerhaps cutting the tree down would be a good idea?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_15;Cut it down!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_15;Leave it be!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_18;After cutting down the strangely glowing tree, you discover that one of the branches apparently is hollow. Inside the branch, you find a jewel-encrusted sword hilt which seems to be emitting a slight glow, much like the tree once did.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_18;This might be worth keeping...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_17;You cut down the banyan tree and start chopping up the wood, looking for the source of the strange glow, but it would seem that you cut down the wondrous tree for nothing. Doubtlessly, the people in the area will not appreciate losing the tree.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_17;Oh, well...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_20;You bring the strangely glowing hilt and blade you own together and discover that it is a perfect fit. As you do so, the words Thuan Thien - Heaven's Will - come to you, and you at once know what to call your new sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_20;Bow before Heaven's Will!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_21;The sword Thuan Thien has served you well, but of late you have started to get the feeling that perhaps it is time for Heaven's Will to be passed on. The feeling is particularly strong whenever you walk past a lake in [thuan_thien_lake.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_21;Throw the sword into the lake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_21;I will keep the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_22;Word has reached your court that there is a fisherman in [artifact_province.GetName] that has discovered a wondrous glowing blade on one of his fishing trips. Perhaps you should try to find him?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_22;Yes, I must see this blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_22;I have no time for rumours!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_23;You manage to track down the fisherman you were looking for in [artifact_province.GetName], but the blade he shows you is utterly remarkable and clearly not glowing. Apparently he was exaggerating the importance of his discovery.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_23;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_23;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_24;You find the fisherman you were looking for in [artifact_province.GetName] too late, for he tells you that he sold the blade he had found to a passing wanderer a few days ago and that he has no idea where the man went.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_24;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_24;Give me the money, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_24;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_26;The Glowing Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_26;It takes you some time to track down the fisherman you are looking for in [artifact_province.GetName], but eventually you find the man. He invites you into his home and shows you the blade he discovered, and you can see the glow emitted by the blade for yourself.\n\n"I would like to keep the blade, my [Root.GetLordLady]," the man tells you. "However, if you are prepared to pay my price, I will reluctantly part with it." He names a price that is considerably higher than you would have hoped for.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_26;I'll pay your price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_26;Guards! Get me that blade!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_26;Keep the blade!!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_28;The Glowing Blade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_28;You spend some time searching for the fisherman who supposedly discovered the blade in [artifact_province.GetName] and are about to give up hope when you finally discover someone who knows where to find him. You make your way to his home and are welcomed inside by the old man.\n\n"I did discover a glowing blade, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he tells you, quickly fetching it so that you might see it for yourself. "I have long questioned what I should do with the blade, for I did not think it was truly meant for me, and now I know that it is to be yours. Take it, please!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_28;Thank you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_30;Word has reached you that an ancient tomb has been discovered in [artifact_province.GetName]. Based on the inscriptions that have been discovered in the tomb, it might be the legendary Tomb of Three Kings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_30;I must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_30;I have no time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_31;The Tomb of Three Kings?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_31;You have no trouble reaching the tomb that recently was discovered in [artifact_province.GetName]. The inscriptions do seem to point towards it being the legendary Tomb of Three Kings, which is associated with the swords Ganjiang and Moye.\n\nThere are three paths leading forward from the antechamber, all of which might lead towards your goal, but you suspect that there might be traps and other obstacles in your way regardless of which way you head.\n\nWhich way do you wish to explore?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_31;The right path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_31;The middle path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_31;The left path;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ARTIFACTS_31;Actually, I'll head home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_32;The Trapped Passage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_32;You head some distance down your chosen passageway, looking for any sign of the swords you seek. The corridor is fairly plain at first, compared to the antechamber, but eventually you start to discover more carvings, statues, and other decorations.\n\nJust as you are about to take a step past an imposing statue of a soldier, you accidentally kick a loose rock down your path. It bounces past the statue and strikes a fairly innoculous piece of the floor. Immediately, you hear a faint sound and some metal darts come flying out of one of the walls.\n\nIt would seem the way forward is trapped.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_32;I think I got this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_32;This is child's play!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_32;I can't risk this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_33;You make your way forward into the trapped hallway, stepping as carefully as possible. At first, everything goes well, but you make one wrong move at the wrong time and trigger an unseen trap. Grievously wounded, you are forced to fall back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_33;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_34;You make your way forward into the trapped hallway, stepping as carefully as possible. However, despite avoiding a few traps, you fail to notice that a section of the floor has been built to collapse when stepped upon, and you fall into a spike-filled pit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_34;NO!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_35;You make your way forward into the trapped hallway, stepping as carefully as possible. The people who designed the traps were skilled enough that they would be able to catch a careless graverobber, but not skilled enough to stop you, and you easily get past the traps.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_35;That was easy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_36;As you step back into the antechamber, you feel one of the stone tiles sink slightly beneath your weigh. One of the guards you left outside the tomb cries for you to get outside as the entrance is closing rapidly, and you barely manage to do so in time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_36;This was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_37;The Maze;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_37;You move deeper and deeper into the tomb along your chosen passageway. At first, you have only one way forward, but after a while you discover an intersection.\n\nYou carefully move down one of the paths, reaching another intersection very quickly. Backtracking to the first intersection, you explore the other paths leading away from it, confirming your initial suspicion.\n\nYou have encountered a maze, doubtlessly meant to confuse anyone who is seeking the tomb's treasures. If you can find the path through it, you might find what you seek, but you might also get lost along the way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_37;Here goes nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_37;Always keep to one wall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_37;I can't risk this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_38;You start exploring the maze, trying to reach whatever lies at the other side. However, you have no success before your food and water starts running low, and you shift your priorities to getting back out, which you eventually manage to do.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_38;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_39;You start exploring the maze, trying to reach whatever lies at the other side. Before long, you are hopelessly lost in the maze, with no idea as to where the entrance is. As your food and water runs out, you desperately try to escape, but it is all for naught.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_39;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_40;You start exploring the maze, trying to reach whatever lies at the other side. It is more extensive than you had expected it to be, but eventually you reach what seems to be the other side, as there is once more a single corridor leading deeper into the tomb.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_40;That wasn't so hard!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_41;The Bear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_41;As you move deeper and deeper into the tomb, you start wondering what dangers might lie ahead. You cannot find any signs of traps or other similar obstacles, which is slightly worrying. Perhaps the architects did not have enough funding to create such things, but that is unlikely.\n\nAfter a while, you come across what appears to be an unreachable opening leading back out of the tomb. As you start wondering about the reason for such an opening, you hear the roar of a bear coming from somewhere ahead.\n\nYou doubt the bear was put in the tomb when it was constructed, but it still bars your path.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_41;I think I've got this...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_41;Bears are easy to kill!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_41;Slowly back away...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_42;You ready your weapon and move forward to face the bear. It appears to be slightly wary of your weapon at first, but then it sees an opening and pounces on it. You manage to make it back off, but you have been grievously injured and need to fall back.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_42;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_43;You ready your weapon and move forward to face the bear. It avoids your feeble attacks with relative ease and then pounces on you before you can react. Despite your best attempts to fight back, you do not last long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_43;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_44;You ready your weapon and move forward to face the bear. It does not seem to respect you or your weapon and rushes forward, but you easily move out of its way and inflict a severe wound. The same thing happens several more times, and eventually the bear draws its last breath.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_44;I got it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_46;You manage to reach the burial chamber at the heart of the tomb, and quickly discover a well-crafted sword lying with the rest of the grave goods. Judging by the inscription on the hilt, you have found the sword Ganjiang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_46;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_47;You manage to reach the burial chamber at the heart of the tomb, and quickly discover a well-crafted sword lying with the rest of the grave goods. Judging by the inscription on the hilt, you have found the sword Moye.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_47;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_48;You manage to reach the burial chamber at the heart of the tomb. Unfortunately, there are no artifacts of note to be found, but you suspect that you can make a tiny profit from the grave goods you found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_48;Better than nothing...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_49;You manage to reach the burial chamber at the heart of the tomb. However, it would appear someone else has gotten there before you, for the sarcophagus and the grave goods have been destroyed and nothing of value is to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_49;What a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_50;Two young peasant women recently came to your court, seeking an audience. After being brought into your presence, they tell you that they came across three princely men in [artifact_province.GetName], one of them claiming descent from Alexander the Great.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_50;I must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_50;I have no time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_51;You reach [artifact_province.GetName] and start looking around for signs of the men that the two young women spoke of. Your initial search does not turn up any signs of the presence of the aforementioned strangers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_51;Keep looking!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_51;This was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_51;Punish the women and leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_52;The Bandit Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_52;As you search for the mysterious stranges that the young women claimed that they had encountered, one of your guards comes running towards you.\n\n"There is a large force of bandits approaching this hill, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he hurriedly informs you. "We need to know if we are staying to fight them or not, as we have little time to waste if we are going to attempt to escape."\n\nYou cannot tell if the two peasant women intentionally lured you into an ambush or not, but determining that will have to wait until after the battle, if you choose to stay.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_52;To arms!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_52;We have already won!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_52;Run away!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_53;You and your guards meet the bandits head on as they start moving up the hill, catching them by surprise with your ferocity. The battle lasts for some time, but you and your men emerge victorious and mostly unharmed. What do you wish to do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_53;Ignore the women and keep looking;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_53;Ignore the women and leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_53;Punish the women and leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_54;You and your guards meet the bandits head on as they start moving up the hill. The battle is far too close for your liking, but eventually you emerge victorious, though grievously wounded. What do you wish to do now?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_54;Ignore the women and keep looking;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_54;Ignore the women and leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_54;Punish the women and leave;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_55;You and your guards meet the bandits head on as they start moving up the hill, but they are prepared for your charge and inflict heavy losses on your side very quickly. Before long, you are surrounded and cut down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_55;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_57;You are about to give up hope when one of your guards cries out that he has found something. Moving over to him, you discover a magnificient sword, fit for a great [Root.GetTitle] like yourself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_57;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_58;You keep looking for signs of the princely men the women claimed to have seen, but you find nothing at all, and eventually you are forced to conclude that they either were spreading rumours or that the men left nothing for you to find.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_58;This was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_60;A young Hindu priest approached you today, asking you to come with him to a hidden shrine in [artifact_province.GetName]. His only request is that you pay for the extensive offerings he wishes to leave at the shrine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_60;Of course!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_60;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_61;It would seem that the young Hindu priest you met the other day has vanished without a trace. When questioning the priests at a nearby temple, they claim that they have never met a man matching the description of the missing priest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_61;Find that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_62;With the preparations finalized, you and the young Hindu priest set out towards the hidden shrine in [artifact_province.GetName], bringing with you plentiful offerings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_62;Onwards!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_63;You eventually arrive at the shrine the young priest has been telling you about during the journey. However, despite the man claiming that it would be a wondrous sight to behold, it is little more than an overgrown ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_63;Well, this was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_63;You will suffer for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_64;The Hidden Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_64;After a long journey, you and the young priest arrive at the shrine you set out to reach in [artifact_province.GetName], and it truly is a sight to behold. Impressive carvings of various Hindu mythological figures decorate the walls, and statues of Kali, Shiva, Vishnu, and other gods are located both inside and outside the shrine itself.\n\nFor some unknown reason, the young priest who came there with you seems somewhat disappointed during the visit, and he seems to grow even more so over time as he study the carvings and statues. You leave him at it and just take in the scenery. This journey certainly was worthwhile.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_64;A most impressive shrine!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_64;Impressive, but not holy!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_64;I should convert to Hindu!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ARTIFACTS_64;I should convert, secretly...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_65;The Hidden Shrine;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_65;After a long journey, you and the young priest arrive at the shrine you set out to reach in [artifact_province.GetName], and it truly is a sight to behold. Impressive carvings of various Hindu mythological figures decorate the walls, and statues of Kali, Shiva, Vishnu, and other gods are located both inside and outside the shrine itself.\n\nAs you enjoy the scenery, the young priest with you studies the walls carefully and eventually lets out a triumphant cry. Looking over towards him, you see him push on one of the stones in one of the walls, revealing a doorway.\n\n"I'll be right back," he tells you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_65;I'll come with you!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_65;I think I'll leave...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_66;You and the young priest descend down a stairway illuminated only by the flickering light of the torch you are bringing with you. As you reach the bottom just behind the young man, you see him draw a knife from a sheath on his belt.\n\n"You should leave now, my [Root.GetLordLady]," he says. "If not, you will die!";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_66;You dare threaten me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_66;Fine! I will leave!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_67;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. It is a difficult fight due to the light and the confined space, but eventually you get the upper hand and strike the young man down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_67;I despise traitors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_68;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. He manages to inflict a grievous wound on you during the fight, but eventually you get the upper and and strike him down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_68;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_69;You draw your own weapon and engage the young priest in the dimly lit hallway. At first, the fight seems to be going your way, but the young man then makes an unexpected attack and inflict a lethal injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_69;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_71;Stepping past the body of the traitorous priest, you move further down the passageway and eventually reach an altar. While somewhat impressive, there does not appear to be anything of value in the room, so the priest's betrayal truly was strange.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_71;This was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_72;Stepping past the body of the traitorous priest, you move further down the passageway and eventually reach an altar. A statue of Shiva stands above the altar, holding a bow as if he is offering it to you. You suspect that you have found the legendary Vijaya.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_72;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_73;You have heard rumours that there is a village in [artifact_province.GetName] where an ancient buried sword recently was discovered. If the rumours are to be believed, it is unusually sharp and fairly ornate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_73;I should investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_73;I have no time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_75;You arrive at the village in [artifact_province.GetName] and start asking around for the sword. Unfortunately, you quickly discover that it simply was a drunken tale told by some youngsters trying to impress a passing merchant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_75;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_75;You will all pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_76;You arrive at the village in [artifact_province.GetName] and start asking around for the sword. However, it would seem you have arrived too late, for the villagers tell you that they sold the sword to a passing merchant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_76;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_76;Give me the money you got!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_76;You will all pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_77;The Sword of Goujian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_77;The villagers in the village in [artifact_province.GetName] that you sought out welcome you courteously enough upon arrival and are happy to show you the sword that they found when you ask about it.\n\nThe ancient script on the blade is unlike any presently in use that you are familiar with, but you understand it well enough to determine that the blade must once have belonged to King Goujian of Yue, who lived during the Spring and Autumn period.\n\n"We would be happy to sell the sword to you, my [Root.GetLordLady]," one of the villagers tells you upon noticing that you seem to be interested in the blade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_77;I'll pay your price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_77;Guards! Get me that sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_77;Keep the sword!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_78;Word has reached you that a group of merchants travelling through [artifact_province.GetName] that attempted to take a shortcut through the wilderness stumbled upon the crumbling ruins of an ancient fortress.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_78;I must explore this ruin!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_78;I have no time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_79;The Crumbling Fortress;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_79;The ruined fortress looks rather unlike those that have been constructed over the course of the last centuries, though you suppose that it might have been an iposing sight once upon a time. As far as you can determine, it is completely abandoned.\n\nThere are three different parts of the fortress that might be worth exploring - the tallest remaining tower, what remains of the officers' quarters, and what looks like it once was the armory - and you see no reason why you should not be able to explore all of them.\n\nWhere would you like to start?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_79;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_79;Go to the officers' quarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_79;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_80;The tallest tower of the fortress has seen better days. While it still is standing and does not appear to be in any immediate danger of collapsing as a whole, the stairway leading to the top looks like it could collapse at any moment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_80;Try to climb the stairs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_80;Go to the officers' quarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_80;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ARTIFACTS_80;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_81;You start heading up the crumbling stairs, stepping as carefully as possible. It appears capable of supporting your weight at first, but suddenly a step gives out beneath you. You fall hard, suffering a grievous injury as the stairs collapse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_81;Go to the officers' quarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_81;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_81;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_82;You start heading up the crumbling stairs, stepping as carefully as possible. After ascending some distance towards the top, you step in the wrong place and the whole structure collapses, burying you beneath the rubble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_82;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_84;You start heading up the crumbling stairs, stepping as carefully as possible. After some time, you manage to reach the top. There does not appear to be anything of value there, but at least the view of the countryside is impressive.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_84;Go to the officers' quaarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_84;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_84;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_85;You start heading up the crumbling stairs, stepping as carefully as possible. After some time, you manage to reach the top. You discover a few coins that appear to be quite old and that probably are worth something, but nothing else of value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_85;Go to the officers' quaarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_85;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_85;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_86;You start heading up the crumbling stairs, stepping as carefully as possible. After some time, you manage to reach the top. In one corner of the room at the top of the stairs, you find the tip of an ancient spear, with an inscription that claims it once belonged to King Fuchai of Wu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_86;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_87;You reach the building where the officers' quarters are located and start looking through the rooms. You do not manage to find any valuables, but you discover a blocked doorway that appears to lead into a room that is larger than the others.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_87;Attempt to clear the rubble aside;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_87;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_87;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ARTIFACTS_87;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_88;You try to move the rubble out of the way, but it turns out to be too heavy for you to make much progress. After some time, you are forced to accept that you simply lack the strength to move any but the smallest pieces aside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_88;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_88;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_88;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_89;You try to move the rubble out of the way, and make steady progress. Eventually, you have cleared enough space to squeese through, though not before hurting yourself due to some of the rubble collapsing on top of you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_89;At least I got past it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_90;You try to move the rubble out of the way, and it does not pose any real difficulty. It takes some time, to be sure, but you are in no real hurry and are both careful and strong enough to clear the way forward without any difficulty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_90;Let's see what we can find...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_92;The room behind the blocked doorway probably once belonged to the top officer in the fortress. Not much of note remains iside, but you do manage to discover what appears to be a page from the Art of War that somehow has survived this long.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_92;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_92;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_92;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_93;The room behind the blocked doorway probably once belonged to the top officer in the fortress. You manage to discover some ancient coins inside the room, but nothing else of value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_93;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_93;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_93;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_94;The room behind the blocked doorway probably once belonged to the top officer in the fortress. You had hoped that there would be something of value left inside, but either the original owner took his valuables with him or some looters cleared out the room in the past.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_94;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_94;Go to the armory;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_94;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_95;The room behind the blocked doorway probably once belonged to the top officer in the fortress. In one corner of the room, you find the tip of an ancient spear, with an inscription that claims it once belonged to King Fuchai of Wu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_95;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_96;The fortress' armory appers to have been cleared out, whether by the original occupants or by looters, in the past. However, you do manage to find what appears to be a hidden doorway towards the back, though there is no obvious way to open it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_96;Search the room;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_96;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_96;Go to the officers' quaarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTD_ARTIFACTS_96;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_97;You spend some time searching the room, looking for a way to open the hidden doorway. However, your search does not bear fruit, and you start to wonder if you were mistaken about the doorway in the first place.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_97;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_97;Go to the officers' quaarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_97;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_99;You spend some time searching the room, looking for a way to open the hidden doorway. Eventually, you figure out how to do it, and you uncover a small hidden room. Unfortunately, it does not seem to contain anything at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_99;Go to the tallest tower;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_99;Go to the officers' quaarters;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_99;I should return home...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_100;You spend some time searching the room, looking for a way to open the hidden doorway. Eventually, you figure out how to do it, and you uncover a small hidden room. In one corner of the room, you find the tip of an ancient spear, with an inscription that claims it once belonged to King Fuchai of Wu.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_100;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_101;Word has reached you that there is a wise old blademaster living in [artifact_province.GetName] who possesses both remarkable skill and a remarkable sword. Perhaps it is worth seeking him out, to learn from him or to try to duel him for the blade?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_101;I must find him!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_101;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_102;You arrive in [artifact_province.GetName] and start asking around for the blademaster you seek. Unfortunately, you learn that he passed away before your arrival and that one of his students vanished with his sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_102;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_103;The Blademaster;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_103;You arrive in [artifact_province.GetName] and start asking around for the blademaster you seek. Luckily for you, you find someone who can direct you to the village where the old man lives, and you quickly locate the man you seek.\n\n"Ah, [Root.GetBestName], I have heard of you," the man says upon meeting you. "Have you come to study under me, perhaps?" He glances at the sword at your side. "I can teach you a few tricks, for a small sum of money, if you wish. Or did you perhaps come here to challenge me for my sword, like any number of dead fools?";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_103;I'll pay your price!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_103;I challenge you, old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_103;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_104;You pay the man's price. He instructs you to draw your sword and defend yourself as he draws his own and starts to test your defences.\n\n"I believe I can think of several things to teach you," the man says after a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_104;Let us begin, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_105;Your training under the old blademaster has progressed fairly well, and he frequently praises your ability to master new techniques. While your training is not over, it has definitely been worthwhile already.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_105;I know a new trick or two!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_105;I have learned a great deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_105;Coming here was a good idea!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_106;Your training under the old blademaster has not gone as well as you would have hoped, and one day your practice with the sword goes poorly enough that you inadvertedly take a fairly unpleasant wound from the old man's sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_106;Ow!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_107;Your training under the old blademaster has not gone as well as you would have hoped. You try your best, but you frequently take cuts from the old man despite him trying not to wound you, and one day you suffer a major injury.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_107;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_108;You have been struggling to learn under the old blademaster without any real success, and one day the practice goes really poorly. You do not know what your mistake was, but suddenly you are bleeding out from a major wound caused by the old man's sword.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_108;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_109;After studying under the old blademaster for over a year, you note that the man has stopped trying to teach you new techniques.\n\n"I cannot teach you anything more," the man tells you when questioned. "I believe this is where we must part ways.";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_109;Farewell, then!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_109;I challenge you, old man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_111;You draw your sword and charge the old blademaster, confident that you can overcome him. It is a closer fight than you would have expected, but eventually you are triumphant.\n\n"Well fought," the man manages to croak before the life leaves his body.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_111;Inspect the man's sword;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_112;You draw your sword and charge the old blademaster, confident that you can overcome him. However, despite being fairly old, he does not appear to suffer much from his age and you soon suffer a lethal blow.\n\n"How disappointing," you hear the man say as your vision fades.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_112;Not like this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_114;The old blademaster's sword is no ordinary tachi. Its tip is symmetrical and both edges are sharp rather than just one of them. You know enough about Japanese swords to recognize it as Kogarasu Maru - Little Crow - that was forged by the legendary swordsmith Amakuni.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_114;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_115;The sword that belonged to the old blademaster is exquisite. It is an old katana, and you know enough about Japanese swords to recognize it as Dojigiri - Slayer of Shuten-doji - that was forged by Hoki-no-Kuni Yasutsuna. It is one of the Tenka-Goken, the Five Best Swords under Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_115;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_116;The sword that belonged to the old blademaster is quite extraordinary. You know enough about Japanese swords to recognize it as Onimaru - Demon - that was forged by Awataguchi Sakon-no-Shogen Kunitsuna. It is one of the Tenka-Goken, the Five Best Swords under Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_116;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_117;The tempering of the sword that belonged to the old blademaster has a crescent-moon-shaped pattern. You know enough about Japanese swords to recognize it as Mikazuki - Crescent Moon - that was forged by Sanjo Kokaji Munechika. It is one of the Tenka-Goken, the Five Best Swords under Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_117;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_118;The sword that belonged to the old blademaster is quite extraordinary. You know enough about Japanese swords to recognize it as odenta - Great Denta, or The Best among Swords Forged by Denta - that was forged by Miike Denta Mitsuyo. It is one of the Tenka-Goken, the Five Best Swords under Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_118;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_119;The sword that belonged to the old blademaster has a juzu - a Buddhist rosary - decorating it. You know enough about Japanese swords to recognize it as Juzumaru - Rosary - that was forged by Aoe Tsunetsugu. It is one of the Tenka-Goken, the Five Best Swords under Heaven.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_119;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_120;You would have thought that the sword belonging to your former teacher would be of high quality, but upon closer inspection you discover that is is neither famous, of high quality, or even well-maintained. It is a wonder it did not break mid-duel.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_120;This was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_121;A young man who claims to be an explorer has arrived at your court. He tells you that he believes that he knows the location of one of the swords forged by the anciet swordmaker Ou Yezi and that he is prepared to give it to you if you finance his expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_121;Of course I will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_121;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_123;The young explorer you hired to seek out one of Ou Yezi's swords has vanished without a trace, along with the money that you gave him. At first, you thought it merely took him slightly longer than expected to find the sword, but eventually you realize that he is not returning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_123;Someone find that man!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_124;The young explorer you hired to seek out one of Ou Yezi's swords has returned to your court. He informs you that finding the sword was more difficult than expected and that he needs some extra funds to finish the expedition.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_124;Of course I will pay!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_124;I think not!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_126;The young explorer you hired to seek out one of Ou Yezi's swords has vanished without a trace, along with the money that you gave him. Perhaps he was merely stringing you along for the money, or perhaps something has happened to him on his journey.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_126;I will never be sure...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_127;The young explorer you hired to seek out one of Ou Yezi's swords has returned to your court. He informs you that someone else must have beaten him to the sword as there was nothing of value to be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_127;That is unfortunate...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_127;I'll have your head for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_128;The young explorer you hired to seek out one of Ou Yezi's swords has returned to your court. He presents an ancient sword to you with a bow.\n\n"Behold the sword Zhanlu, my [Root.GetLordLady]!" he proclaims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_128;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_129;The young explorer you hired to seek out one of Ou Yezi's swords has returned to your court. He presents an ancient sword to you with a bow.\n\n"Behold the sword Juque, my [Root.GetLordLady]!" he proclaims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_134;The young explorer you hired to seek out one of Ou Yezi's swords has returned to your court. He presents an ancient sword to you with a bow.\n\n"Behold the sword Tai'e, my [Root.GetLordLady]!" he proclaims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_134;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_135;The young explorer you hired to seek out one of Ou Yezi's swords has returned to your court. He presents an ancient sword to you with a bow.\n\n"Behold the sword Gongbu, my [Root.GetLordLady]!" he proclaims.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_135;Well done!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_136;A minor nobleman in your realm who recently died named you as the inheritor to a faded old map of [artifact_province.GetName] in his possession. At first, you were considering throwing it away, but it is possible that it might lead to something valuable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_136;I must investigate this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_136;I have no time for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_137;You arrive in [artifact_province.GetName] and start looking for the landmarks on your map. However, it does not take you long to realize that the map does not match the geography at all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_137;Curses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTTITLE_ARTIFACTS_138;A Rival Expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_138;As you arrive in [artifact_province.GetName], word reaches you that there is another expedition present that is following an old map of its own. You head to investigate these rumours and find that the other expedition appears to be heading in the same direction as your map indicates that you should be heading in.\n\nYou could probably pay the expedition off, or attempt to attack them to force them to withdraw, but if you cannot do that you have no other option than to return home without whatever your map leads towards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_138;We must attack!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_138;I should bribe them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_ARTIFACTS_138;Heading home it is!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_139;You and your men manage to circle around the other expedition and prepare an ambush in their path. Everything goes according to plan, and soon you are chasing the last stragglers away from the site of the brief battle.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_139;Onwards to the treasure!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_140;You and your men manage to circle around the other expedition and prepare an ambush in their path. Things go poorly, and you suffer a grievous injury during the battle. As your followers are being cut down, you decide that discretion is the better part of valor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_140;Fall back!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_141;You and your men attempt to circle around the other expedition to prepare an ambush in their path, but you walk into an ambush set by the other expedition along the way. With no way to escape, you and your followers are all cut down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_141;No!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_142;You send a man to negotiate with the leader of the other expedition, hoping to pay him to step aside. He is surprisingly open to the suggestion and even offers his service and that of his men for the sum you initially offer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_142;Sounds great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_144;You and your men spend some time searching for the old ruins the map supposedly leads to, but eventually you are forced to conclude that they are nowhere to be found despite the landmarks matching the map.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_144;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_145;You and your men spend some time searching for the old ruins the map supposedly leads to, and eventually you find them. However, there is nothing of value to be found in the ruins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_145;This was a waste...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_146;You and your men spend some time searching for the old ruins the map supposedly leads to, and eventually you find them. The only thing of note to be found in the ruins is some old coins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_146;Could have been worse...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_147;You and your men spend some time searching for the old ruins the map supposedly leads to, and eventually you find them. The only notable thing you manage to discover in the ruins is an old inscription giving some interesting insights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_147;I suppose this will be useful...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_148;You and your men spend some time searching for the old ruins the map supposedly leads to, and eventually you find them. Beneath some rubble, you manage to uncover an ancient sword that seems fit to be a symbol of your authority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_148;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_149;You and your men spend some time searching for the old ruins the map supposedly leads to, and eventually you find them. After some searching, you find an ancient guandao that appears to be coated with a thin layer of blood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_149;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_150;You have heard rumours of a remote shrine in [artifact_province.GetName] where there supposedly exists a Shinto text of great importance. Which text it might be is somewhat unclear, but it could be worth tracking down these rumours.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_150;I must seek it out!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_150;I have better things to do;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_151;You seek out the shrine in [artifact_province.GetName] and ask about the sacred text they keep there. Your inquiry is met with confusion, and the priestesses inform you that they have never had a text of great importance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_151;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_151;You will pay for this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_152;You seek out the shrine in [artifact_province.GetName] and ask about the sacred text they keep there. The priestesses bring out a few different texts in their possession, but they do not appear to be extremely important.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_152;They were still nice, though;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_153;You seek out the shrine in [artifact_province.GetName] and ask about the sacred text they keep there. One of the priestesses brings out a copy of the Kojiki - the Records of Ancient Matters - for you to inspect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_153;Guards! I desire that text!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_153;Thank you for showing me this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_154;You seek out the shrine in [artifact_province.GetName] and ask about the sacred text they keep there. One of the priestesses brings out a copy of the Nihon Shoki - the Chronicles of Japan - for you to inspect.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_154;Guards! I desire that text!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_154;Thank you for showing me this!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_155;Some peasants in your realm came across an old tome containing what looks like some kind of writing, though not written in a way you or your advisors can read. They have seen fit to gift it to you since you might find it interesting.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_155;Attempt to decipher it;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTB_ARTIFACTS_155;It probably is worthless;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_156;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated has turned out to be impossible to decipher despite the efforts of some of the brightest men and women in your realm.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_156;Curses!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_157;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated contained some insights from an era long gone. While not truly groundbreaking discoveries, you believe that these insights might prove to have some value.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_157;I suppose that's good...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_ARTIFACTS_158;The old tome with the strange writing that you ordered translated has turned out to be more impressive than anticipated. Dubbed the Epic of Darkness, it is a collection of ancient myths and legends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA_ARTIFACTS_158;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
